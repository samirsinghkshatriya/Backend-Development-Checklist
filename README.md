# Backend Development Checklist: (Full Stack Project – 2026)

- [ ] Backend must be completed within first 15 days before starting frontend checklist implementation

# Project Timeline (STRICT DEADLINE – MANDATORY)

- [ ] Backend Development Phase: **12 May 2026 – 27 May 2026 (15 Days)**  
  - Backend must be fully completed, tested, and documented within this period  
  - Includes MongoDB, APIs, authentication, aggregation, and Postman testing  
---

## 0. Dataset Understanding & Project Planning (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

- [ ] JSON dataset received and fully analyzed  
- [ ] Dataset understood properly before writing any code  
- [ ] Dataset converted into proper MongoDB structure (collections & documents format)  
- [ ] All entities (collections) identified from dataset  
- [ ] Relationships between entities clearly defined (reference or embedding)  
- [ ] API requirements mapped from dataset structure  
- [ ] CRUD operations planned for each entity  
- [ ] Data flow between APIs properly understood  


### Important Instructions

- Development should NOT begin without dataset understanding  
- Dataset will be in JSON format, so first:  
  - Understand raw JSON structure properly  
  - Convert it into MongoDB-friendly schema format  
  - Decide collections before writing backend code  
- MongoDB schema design must be finalized before implementation  
- Every API must directly map to dataset structure
